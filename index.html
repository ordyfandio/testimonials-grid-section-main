          the program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that not tutorial could ever have.In fact ,I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.It certainly helped me land a job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend!."</p>
